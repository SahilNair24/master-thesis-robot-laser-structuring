# Research
- Urdf model and other configs for the ABB IRR6660 robotic arm- https://github.com/ros-industrial/abb/tree/kinetic-devel/abb_irb6600_support
- Moveit2 binary install is possible in Windows but requires installation of ROS2 on Windows which may be tricky, Ubuntu would be preferred with ROS2 - https://moveit.ai/install-moveit2/binary-windows/

# 3d cad data formats
- STEP, OBJ, STL, 3DS, IGES, PLY
- More research needed about them

# CAD aaplication
- FreeCAD, CadQuery, OpenSCAD
- CadQuery is preferred, more popular, CadQuery better than OpenSCAD- https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html
- More research can be done or highlighted to explain the choice of software

# Segmentation tool
- Python libraries like Pymesh, Trimesh exist
- Trimesh chosen because has out of the box Windows install, Pymesh has installation instructions only for Linux and MacOS

# CadQuery & cq-editor
## When installed inside mamba
- import cadquery gives an error - ImportError: numpy._core.multiarray failed to import OR Modulenotfounderror - nlopt
- runnning cq-editor in cmd line gives error- ImportError: DLL load failed while importing QtWidgets: The specified module could not be found.

## When installed in system
- The run.bat doesnt load anything

## When installed using cqgui.yml
- ImportError: DLL load failed while importing OCP: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.


## Errors faced initially during cadquery and cq-editor setup(NOW RESOLVED)
- created conda env called "cq-dev"
- installed cadquery with mamba install with mamba install -c conda-forge -c cadquery cadquery=master
        Traceback (most recent call last):

- installed cq-editor with mamba install -c cadquery -c conda-forge cq-editor=master
            The following packages are incompatible

# Moveit2 in WSL
- WSL 2 does not natively support GUI applications, but you can run RViz, MoveIt Setup Assistant, and other GUI tools by:
    -Installing an X server on Windows, such as VcXsrv or Xming

## Pyvista
- conda install -c conda-forge pyvista jupyterlab trame trame-vuetify trame-vtk ipywidgets----very imp 
- render keeps loading forever with pv.set_jupyter_backend('trame'), also with "client" and "server"


##Update for meeting on 25-10
- Went thru tutorial to understand what else could be used 
- Tried different functions, found slicing option to slice a face and then find cell centers of that, compute normals and club into areas 
OR Try to compute normals and club cells into segments depending on the orientation of the normal.
