# Master’s Thesis — A Python-Based Toolpath Generation Framework for Robot-Based Laser Structuring

This repository serves as the central entry point for all modules developed during my Master’s Thesis.
It provides a complete overview of the entire workflow used to segment complex surfaces, perform robotic motion planning, and generate laser toolpaths.

The three stages of the workflow are: \
**CAD Segmentation** -> **Robot Path Planning** -> **Laser Path Planning**

Each stage of the pipeline is implemented as an individual folder in this repository, with its own scripts and documentation.
